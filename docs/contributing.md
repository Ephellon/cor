# Contributing

You can contribute to Cor project forking it on GitHub and submitting a pull request with a feature or bug fix. GitHub accounts can be created [here](https://github.com/join). For contribution follow below instructions.

* All pull requests should be made to the `master` branch.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature or bug fix, be sure to have [tests](../test/index.html).

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the [codebase](https://github.com/yosbelms/cor).

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/yosbelms/cor/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you
find one.

* In your pull request for a feature or bug fix, do not add documentation to `docs/` or rebuild `dist/cor.js` or `dist/crl.js` file. We'll do that for you before cutting a new release. However you can pull request to improve the existing documentation.

* Do not use tickets to ask for help with (debugging) your application. Ask on [Ost.io](http://ost.io/@yosbelms/cor).

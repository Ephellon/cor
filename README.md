**The Language of the Web**

Cor is an opensource language that compiles to plain javascript. It is designed to make easy to write, build, and maintain large software for the web. Cor is an attemp to make myself more productive, it is what I think javascript should have been from the beginning.

Cor brings a fresh way of programming for web browsers and Node.js platform, it borrows good ideas from well known languages such as Go and C#, but it is a new language. It plays very well with the outer world; with Cor you can take advantage of the huge javascript ecosystem and reuse your preferred libraries.
